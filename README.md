## Background
### W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Overview
### I created some Data Frames for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii that gave me all the temps for the days in those months. I then created Data frames that shows the average temps for those months with the lows and the highs.

## June Weather Summary
### - The average temperature for June in Oahu, Hawaii is 74.9°F

### - The lowest temperature for June was 64.0°F

## Summary
### The temperatures are on average about 3°F warmer than temperatures in December which would be better weather for ice cream and surfing. I would suggest we add a query to see the chance of perception to see the chances or rain as well. We could also investigate the humidity as that could affect how those temperatures feel.
